 Living the dream! 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @allensaeteurn
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development for now. :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. React-Native, and NodeJS, Express, MongoDB from Nucamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can add value to and expand my skillsets on front-end.
